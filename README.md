# XJTLU-TC Latex Coursework Template

This is a latex template for XJTLU-TC coursework created by *Taimingwang Liu*.

> Inspired by [the excellent work](https://github.com/feimax/latex_template_for_xjtlu_eee_light) of *Dr.Cheng* and the EEE students of *XJTLU*, I'd like to make a template for <u>not so official</u> use.
> Their template was once used for the doctoral thesis of *Dr.Cheng*, which is somehow too formal for coursework.
